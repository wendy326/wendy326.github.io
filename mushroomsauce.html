                        <p>The original recipe made this sauce with chicken, so meatballs or something would probably be a tasty addition.
                            Also, the recipe said that you can use grated parmesan cheese to replace the flour as a thickening agent, but please
                            remember that Walmart-brand grated parmesan cheese was <em>not</em> what they were talking about. It didn't help thicken 
                            up the sauce at all, and all the cheese kinda clumped together. Also it was too salty. I used portobello mushrooms, but I'm sure white 
                            mushrooms or whatever would work too. For the chicken broth, I made it using the concentrated powder, following
                            the instructions on the box which worked fine. This recipe makes quite a bit, about 3.5 meals.
