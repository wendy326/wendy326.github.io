                        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
                                <li>2 tsp instant yeast</li>
                                <li>1 1/4 tsp salt</li>
                                <li>1 1/2 cups very warm (not hot) tap water</li>
                                <li>extra flour for dusting</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Directions</h3>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In large bowl, mix flour, yeast, and salt.</li>
                                <li>Add water and mix until well incorporated.</li>
                                <li>Cover with cling wrap and let rise for 2 - 3 hours, or until doubled in volume.</li>
                                <li>Place a metal baking dish in the rack below the center rack and preheat oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
                                <li>Sprinkle work surface with 1 tbsp flour, scrape dough out of bowl. Sprinkle top with 1/2 tbsp flour.</li>
                                <li>Using a dough scraper, fold the sides inwards (about 6 folds) to roughly form a roundish shape.</li>
                                <li>Slide a large piece of parchment next to the dough, then flip the dough seam side down onto the paper. Push it towards the middle, then reshape it into a round(ish) shape.</li>
                                <li>Boil kettle and place paper + dough on a baking tray.</li>
                                <li>As quickly as possible place bread in oven center rack, fill baking dish with boiling water, and shut oven door.</li>
                                <li>Bake for 40 to 42 minutes.</li>
                                <li>Cool on rack for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>I used an extra 1/2 cup or so of water because my dough was too dry. The original recipe has a nice 
                        video that shows how the dough should look as you're making it. After letting it rise, it should wobble 
                        like jelly and have lots of bubbles. You can then refrigerate dough for up to 3 days for more yeasty flavor.
                        If you do so, let dough come up to room temp for 45 - 60 min before baking. The step with the boiling water 
                        is intended to create a dutch oven steamer effect without the dutch oven. As with all breads, you want to let
                        this cool for a bit before slicing so it doesn't deflate.</p>
                        <p>This makes a very moist, slightly mushy, slightly chewy
                        bread, probably because there was no kneading. It's pretty good toasted and very low effort, although not 
                        my first choice for bread because of the lack of internal structure even though it has a good rise.</p>
