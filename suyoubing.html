                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In a medium bowl, combine water, 1 tbsp oil, and baking soda</li>
                                <li>Gradually add flour until the dough is not sticky, but still very soft</li>
                                <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface and split into 2 inch diameter balls</li>
                                <li>In a small bowl, make 油酥 using flour and oil</li>
                                <li>Using a rolling pin, roll out the dough balls, then add a dollop of 油酥 to the center. Pinch the edges of the dough together like a baozi</li>
                                <li>Flatten them with your palm and roll them out again with a rolling pin</li>
                                <li>Roll each flattened pancake up into a log, like you would with a cinnamon roll</li>
                                <li>Take the ends of each log and twist, like wringing out a towel, and [com]press it flat like a pop can</li>
                                <li>Roll them out with the rolling pin again</li>
                                <li>Place a dollop of your filling of choice (instructions below) in the center, and pinch the edges of the dough together again, just like before</li>
                                <li>Flatten them with your palm and roll them out slightly, so they're about 1/2 an inch thick</li>
                                <li>Brush the pancakes lightly with oil and place them on the griddle (~350 degrees F)</li>
                                <li>Cook on the griddle until the outside looks slightly goden brown and the inside looks cooked</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>

                                        <li>Note: 2/3 of the flour can be cooked in order to have more defined layers in the pancake</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                        <li>Mix together peanut butter and flour</li>
                                        <li>Note: I haven't tried this myself, nor have I seen it tried before, so idk how much flour would be needed</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Jam
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Mix together jam and flour</li>
                                        <li>Note: I haven't tried this myself, nor have I seen it tried before, so idk how much flour would be needed</li>
                                        <li>Note pt 2: idk how well fruity flavors would work with this recipe. also, idk if the flour would work to thicken this up</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ol> 
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm not sure what the exact quantities of each ingredient are, but I put the amount for the water 
                            and oil for the dough for a ratio. For the filling, remember that if it you are putting something 
                            very thin into the pancake or something that has a tendency to get thin/melt under heat, add some 
                            flour to thicken it up. Also, I personally prefer sweeter fillings, so I've inclulded more of those, 
                            but I'm sure that there's a lot more savory ones.
